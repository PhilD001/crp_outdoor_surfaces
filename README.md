  PNG – It contains following
  •	Graphs for 3 gait cycles 
	  o	In some of the gait cycles the 3rd gait cycle has extra cycles detected
	  o	Cycles with more than 150 frames of data is excluded for the 2nd gait cycle
  •	Middle gait cycle Graphs for all participants for each surface 
	  o	 It will allow us to remove the gait cycles for which estimation is not good.
  I had taken a mean for each participant on each of the surfaces for masters 
  (which lowered overall effect of the wrongly estimated angles)
  •	Mean and Mean for all participants shows that mean data.

  	FinalOutput -- contains all the data
  	Joint_angle – code for the estimation  
  	Calibration_Code and Calibration_data – contains data used for knee angle correction
